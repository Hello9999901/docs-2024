Adam Tang:

- Looked at jesuit design
  - No sides, efficient modular design with standardized bars
    - Kept walls
      - Water bottle used as floatation/weight
- Started to combine features of each of our diagrams
- 6 thrusters instead of 7
  - 2 thrusters at the top instead, at the middle instead of 3
  - Side thrusters moved up, so they are closer to center of mass
- Thrusters set at bottom of floatation
- Custom floatation so thrusters can be embedded within
- Gimbal camera mounted on front, can tilt to see the bottom
- Optical sensor on the bottom
- Extra camera on back
- Wire sleeve to combine wires, bind to the frame to keep wires tucked
- Angle brackets to keep the two sides of the frame together, nut and bolt to bind them
- Working on CAD for frame, preliminary budgeting for materials
