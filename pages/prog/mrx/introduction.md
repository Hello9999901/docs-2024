# MRX

MRX is a fork of [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org) extended to run on the [Murex Carrier Board](../../elec/boards/carrier.md). The Ardupilot framework was chosen for it's versatility, documentation and robustness. ArduPilot features drivers for almost every sensor we could consider using and implements logic for sensor fusion, attitude and heading estimation and stabilization. Using ArduPilot also gives us access to a suite of well designed testing software.
