IP ratings, short for "ingress protection ratings" tell the consumer how environmentally resistant an electrical component is. This is usually done through testing at a certified facility (for reputable manufacturers) or randomly chosen (for more sketchy manufacturers). In short, _**do not look at IP ratings**_ as the end all and be all.

In more specificity, ROVs constantly go beyond depths of 1m (general consensus for IPx7). Thus, anything below IPx7 is not acceptable at all without additional waterproofing measures. IP68 is still risky but at least a little more reliable.

It is important to keep in mind that IP ratings are designed for consumers, usually people who drop phones in toilets or use headphones in the rain. _**IP ratings weren't designed for people making underwater robots**_.
