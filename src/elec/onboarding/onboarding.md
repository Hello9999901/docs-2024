# Onboarding

Welcome to MUREX Robotics Electrical. We are a subgroup focused on integration, and efficiency. A few core ideologies follow our design:

> *Attempt the impossible*\
> *Dream Big*\
> *Think Different*

In following such mottos, MUREX Robotics Electrical focuses on making everything custom, highly integrated, and making it as well as we possibly can. By relying on minimal COTS parts, we can vertically integrate all aspects of the robot, and interestingly, minimize cost.

## Required Software

- KiCAD Nightly
- CAD Software
- Text Editor
- Git/GitHub

## Design Process

1. Brainstorm and optimize tech stack
2. Research solutions, focusing on minimizing space while maximizing efficiency
3. Propose solutions with the team, receive feedback and further development
4. Repeat steps 1 and 3 until an idea is fully formed and agreed upon
5. Design schematic in KiCAD
6. Design PCB in KiCAD
7. Silkscreen designing
8. Tapeout verification with the team
9. Production with fabricator (usually JLCPCB)
10. Receive PCB and stress testing
11. Integration into other parts of the tech stack
