# ESC

## Outline

The MUREX ESC module is one of the first ESC agnostic speed controlling systems. It is a compact, high power electronic speed controller (ESC) control board, paired with a general purpose MCU to allow for "universal" compatibility. This allows a variety of modules to be used to fit the application, or allow for rapid replacement in the event of a device failure.

## Detailed Description

There are plans to have multiple, independent versions of this board, hence its "module" name. More modules will be listed below as designs arise.

- B-G431B-ESC1 + RP2040
  - This ESC design utilizes the B-G431B-ESC1 Discovery kit as its driving element. Utilizing a STM32G431CB MCU, L6387 gate drivers, and STL180N6F7 FETs, it is capable of computing FOC (field-oriented control drive) or 6-step trap (trapezoidal) control algorithms. Important features include:
    - 40A peak current
    - OCP/OVP (overcurrent/overvoltage) protection
    - PWM/UART/CAN
    - User configurable LED
    - 3 shunt resistors
  - The RP2040 acts as its abstraction layer. Communicating over UART to the [MUREX Carrier Board](./carrier.md), the RP2040 acts as a bridge between the B-G431B-ESC1 and the rest of the system. This module can also communicate over USB over an on-board USB-C connector (5.1kÎ© pull down on CC1 and CC2 equipped). There are programmable LEDs for immediate end-user feedback and configurable ADC pins for providing rapid telemetry from the ESC. Note that this RP2040 removes any voltage regulation in favor of the [MUREX Power Board](./power.md).
