MUREX isn't just another high school robotics team. With a vision to revolutionize the underwater robotics industry, we push technological boundaries and contribute to the community around us. MUREX doesn't cut corners. MUREX doesn't settle for OK. **We do it right. We think different. We dream bigger. We attempt the impossible.**

> *Open source.*

We fully embrace open source, making sure all of our innovations are available to the community that allowed us to innovate in the first place as well as inspiring the next generation of engineers. All our work is documented here, and almost all work is hosted in open source repositories on GitHub.
